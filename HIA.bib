   abstract = {Research studies are usually carried out on sample of subjects rather than whole populations. The most challenging aspect of fieldwork is drawing a random sample from the target population to which the results of the study would be generalized. In actual practice, the task is so difficult that some sampling bias occurs in almost all studies to a lesser or greater degree. In order to assess the degree of this bias, the informed reader of medical literature should have some understanding of the population from which the sample was drawn. The ultimate decision on whether the results of a particular study can be generalized to a larger population depends on this understanding. The subsequent deliberations dwell on sampling strategies for different types of research and also a brief description of different sampling methods.},

   abstract = {Despite the increased attention given to the health impact assessment of air pollution and to the strategies to control it in both scientific literature and concrete interventions, the results of the implementations, especially those involving traffic, have not always been satisfactory and there is still disagreement about the most appropriate interventions and the methods to assess their effectiveness. This state-of-the-art article reviews the recent interpretation of the concepts that concern the impact assessment, and compares old and new measurements of attributable risk and attributable fraction. It also summarizes the ongoing discussion about the designs and methods for assessing the air pollution impact with particular attention to improvements due to spatio-temporal analysis and other new approaches, such as studying short term effects in cohorts, and the still discussed methods of predicting the values of attributable risk (AR). Finally, the study presents the more recent analytic perspectives and the methods for directly assessing the effects of not yet implemented interventions on air quality and health, in accordance with the suggestion in the strategic plan 2020-2025 from the Health Effect Institute.},

We also summarize the findings on potentially susceptible subgroups across studies.

   abstract = {Australia has relatively diverse sources and low concentrations of ambient fine particulate matter (<2.5 μm, PM(2.5)). Few comparable regions are available to evaluate the utility of continental-scale land-use regression (LUR) models including global geophysical estimates of PM(2.5), derived by relating satellite-observed aerosol optical depth to ground-level PM(2.5) ("SAT-PM(2.5)"). We aimed to determine the validity of such satellite-based LUR models for PM(2.5) in Australia. We used global SAT-PM(2.5) estimates (∼10 km grid) and local land-use predictors to develop four LUR models for year-2015 (two satellite-based, two nonsatellite-based). We evaluated model performance at 51 independent monitoring sites not used for model development. An LUR model that included the SAT-PM(2.5) predictor variable (and six others) explained the most spatial variability in PM(2.5) (adjusted R(2) = 0.63, RMSE (μg/m(3) [%]): 0.96 [14%]). Performance decreased modestly when evaluated (evaluation R(2) = 0.52, RMSE: 1.15 [16%]). The evaluation R(2) of the SAT-PM(2.5) estimate alone was 0.26 (RMSE: 3.97 [56%]). SAT-PM(2.5) estimates improved LUR model performance, while local land-use predictors increased the utility of global SAT-PM(2.5) estimates, including enhanced characterization of within-city gradients. Our findings support the validity of continental-scale satellite-based LUR modeling for PM(2.5) exposure assessment in Australia.},

   abstract = {Odds ratios (OR) are commonly reported in the medical literature as the measure of association between exposure and outcome. However, it is relative risk that people more intuitively understand as a measure of association. Relative risk can be directly determined in a cohort study by calculating a risk ratio (RR). In case-control studies, and in cohort studies in which the outcome occurs in less than 10% of the unexposed population, the OR provides a reasonable approximation of the RR. However, when an outcome is common (iY 10% in the unexposed group), the OR will exaggerate the RR. One method readers can use to estimate the RR from an OR involves using a simple formula. Readers should also look to see that a confidence interval is provided with any report of an OR or RR. A greater understanding of ORs and RRs allows readers to draw more accurate interpretations of research findings.},
