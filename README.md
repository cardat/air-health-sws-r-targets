# Readme

This is an [R targets](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) pipeline for environmental health impact assessment using air pollution as a case study. It has been developed on R 4.1.2 "Bird Hippie" and RStudio 2021.09.2 "Ghost Orchid". It requires R \>= 4.0.0 and access to CARDAT's Environment_General data storage folder on Nextcloud.

The structure and syntax of an R targets pipeline may be unfamiliar to you depending on your level of coding experience. Depending on your intended usage, some or all of the following may guide your understanding of the workflow. Links to further useful examples and documentation are provided in the references.
