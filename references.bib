	abstract = {This document presents recommendations for concentration–response functions for key pollutants to be included in cost–benefit analysis supporting the revision of the European Union’s air quality policy. It provides a response to a question posed by the European Commission in the framework of the WHO “Health risks of air pollution in Europe – HRAPIE” project. The essential background to this response was developed through a review of evidence on health aspects of air pollutants summarized by an earlier WHO project, “Review of evidence on health aspects of air pollution – REVIHAAP”. This report recommends concentration–response functions and associated background information for several mortality and morbidity effects associated with short- and long-term exposure to particulate matter, ozone and nitrogen dioxide. This publication arises from the HRAPIE project and was co-funded by the European Union.},

	abstract = {Australia has relatively diverse sources and low concentrations of ambient fine particulate matter ({\textless}2.5 μm, PM2.5). Few comparable regions are available to evaluate the utility of continental-scale land-use regression (LUR) models including global geophysical estimates of PM2.5, derived by relating satellite-observed aerosol optical depth to ground-level PM2.5 (“SAT-PM2.5”). We aimed to determine the validity of such satellite-based LUR models for PM2.5 in Australia. We used global SAT-PM2.5 estimates (∼10 km grid) and local land-use predictors to develop four LUR models for year-2015 (two satellite-based, two nonsatellite-based). We evaluated model performance at 51 independent monitoring sites not used for model development. An LUR model that included the SAT-PM2.5 predictor variable (and six others) explained the most spatial variability in PM2.5 (adjusted R2 = 0.63, RMSE (μg/m3 [\%]): 0.96 [14\%]). Performance decreased modestly when evaluated (evaluation R2 = 0.52, RMSE: 1.15 [16\%]). The evaluation R2...},
